# Data Slam Dunk: Python script to insert NBA and Top Tech Startups data into a PostgreSQL database

## Overview

Data Slam Dunk is a Python script that reads data from the NBA Players and Team Data and Top Tech Startups Hiring 2023 dataset, and inserts it into a PostgreSQL database in a performative way. The script follows good programming practices, creates separate schema and table for each dataset, and parses JSON data to create columns in the corresponding PostgreSQL table. The project includes tests and documentation to demonstrate the solution's functionality. 

This project was created as part of a challenge in the "desafio-1-mar√ßo-2023" channel on Discord.
